HtmlReportSystem
================
NOTE: This is still in development, don't use it for anything but development.

Easily create reports for use inside your organization.

If you find you need basic in-house reporting against a database this software will allow you to:

* Select one of the data sources defined by your administrator such as a local MySQL database.
* Create data sets from the data sources.  In the example of MySQL this is an SQL query.
* Edit the report through the web interface, reports are in simple HTML with easy to insert components that will allow you to add data from the data source that will be updated each time someone views the report.
* Select a style for the report.
* Add images to the report.
* Add graphs and other widgets to the report.

By default reports are simply displayed in the browser.  For now the goal is to allow you to easily turn it into a pdf by using the print to file "printer" that is probably already installed on your computer.  If anyone would like to do better and add additional formats going forward that would be great.
