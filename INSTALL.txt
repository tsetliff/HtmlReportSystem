Right now this is very Alpha so here are the steps to set it up:

Install CentOS 6.4 or greater to be the report server.

Personally I installed the minimal iso, set up networking, ran updates with:
  yum update

yum install httpd php mod_ssl php-mysql mysql mysql-server
Install your favorite editor.  For me I just used:
yum install vim-enhanced
chkconfig httpd on
chkconfig mysqld on
service httpd start
service mysqld start

Load the schema.sql file into mysql.  Since this is designed for a dedicated server right now it will
create the database as well.
mysql -u root < schema.sql

For minimal configuration copy all of this to /var/www/html
And move the resources directory to /var/www/

Change the ownership of the resources directory to apache:

chown -R apache:apache /var/www/resources

Run composer to pull down the other packages
cd /var/www/html
./composer.phar install

Edit the configure.php file in the project to set up your data sources.
